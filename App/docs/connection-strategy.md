# Application Connection Strategy

This document describes the connection strategy between the application components in the Metaverse Social Practice platform.

## Overview

The application consists of three main components that need to communicate with each other:
- Frontend (Next.js web application)
- Backend API (Node.js + Express API server)
- Database (MongoDB-compatible database, such as MongoDB Atlas, Azure Cosmos DB with MongoDB API, or DocumentDB)

## Platform-Agnostic Architecture

The application is designed to be platform-agnostic, allowing deployment on various cloud providers or on-premises:

┌─────────────┐     HTTP/HTTPS     ┌─────────────┐    MongoDB     ┌─────────────────┐
│   Frontend  │ ─────────────────> │   Backend   │ ─────────────> │  MongoDB-       │

                                        │ Pluggable
                                        ▼
                              ┌───────────────────────┐
                              │ Secrets Management    │
                              │ (Vault/KMS/Env/Cloud) │
                              └───────────────────────┘
```

## Frontend to Backend Connection

The frontend connects to the backend API via HTTP/HTTPS:

1. In development:
   - Direct connection to the local API server (http://localhost:3001)
   - Uses Next.js API proxy for same-origin requests

2. In production:
   - Connection to deployed API endpoint
   - CORS properly configured to allow only approved origins
   - SSL/TLS encryption for all traffic

## Backend to Database Connection

The backend connects to the database using the standard MongoDB driver:

1. Connection string format:
   - Standard MongoDB connection string format
   - Works with any MongoDB-compatible database including:
     - MongoDB Community/Enterprise
     - MongoDB Atlas
     - Azure Cosmos DB with MongoDB API
     - Amazon DocumentDB
     - Self-hosted MongoDB

2. Authentication methods:
   - Username/password authentication
   - Certificate-based authentication (where supported)
   - Connection string stored securely using the secrets manager

## Secrets Management

The application uses a pluggable secrets management system that supports multiple providers:

1. Environment Variables (default for local development)
   - Simple setup with .env files
   - No external dependencies

2. HashiCorp Vault (open standard for secrets management)
   - Open-source solution that can be self-hosted
   - Robust access controls and audit logging
   - Supports dynamic secrets and rotation

3. Cloud Provider Solutions
   - Azure Key Vault
   - AWS Secrets Manager
   - Google Secret Manager

## Environment Isolation

Each environment has its own set of resources:

1. Separate resource groups or projects in the cloud provider
2. Environment-specific connection strings and endpoints
3. Proper network isolation between environments

## Security Considerations

1. All connections use HTTPS/TLS
2. Minimal required permissions for each service connection
3. Network security groups restricting traffic flow
4. Regular secret rotation
5. Proper authentication for all cross-service communication

## Cloud Provider Compatibility

The architecture is designed to work with minimal changes across:

- Microsoft Azure (using Cosmos DB with MongoDB API)
- Amazon Web Services (using DocumentDB or MongoDB Atlas)
- Google Cloud Platform (using MongoDB Atlas)
- On-premises or self-hosted environments (using MongoDB Community/Enterprise)
